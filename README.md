# Risk Assessment Web Application

Application to perform a risk assessment by enumerating business activities, the information assets used in those activities, and the systems and system components used to support those activities. A list of applicable NIST CVE entries can be generated for applications, operating systems, and hardware within each system. These entries include NIST CVSS scoring data that helps assessing the impact of each vulnerability.

This project is still in the beginning stages and was mostly used as a proof-of-concept on how one might approach quantifying security risk and its potential monetary impact on a business.
